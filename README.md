# sofle-keymap
Built myself a gorgeous Sofle v1.1 split ergo mech keyboard - now time to customise the keymap!

JSON file is direct from the VIA webapp, you need to have the VIA firmware loaded first before you can load it.
From the default QMK environment, use the following command to flash the most recent version for the Sofle:

```
qmk flash -kb sofle -km via
```
